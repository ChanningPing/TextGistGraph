0,"Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm the utilized model is able to deal with domainspecic synonymy as well as with polysemous words"
1,"In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing LSI by Singular Value Decomposition the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and denes a proper generative data model"
1,"Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methods as well as over LSI"
1,"In particular the combination of models with dierent dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous"
1,"The performance of PLSI has been systematically compared with the standard term matching method based on the raw term frequencies tf and their combination with the inverse document frequencies tdf as well as with LSI"

0,"The combination weight  with the cosine baseline score has been coarsely optimized by hand MED CRAN   12 CACM CISI   23 in general slightly smaller weights have been utilized for the combined models"
1,"The experiments consistently validate the advantages of PLSI over LSI"
1,"Substantial performance gains have been achieved for all 4 data sets and both term weighting schemes"
1,"In particular PLSIQPLSIQ work particularly well on the raw term frequencies where LSI on the other hand may even fail completely in accordance with the results 56 reported in 1"
1,"We explain this by the fact that large frequencies dominate the squared error deviation used in SVD and a dampening eg by idf weighting is necessary to get a reasonable decomposition of the termdocument matrix"
1,"Since PLSIQ can not take much advantage from the term weighting scheme PLSIUPLSIU performs slightly better in this case"
1,"We suspect that even better results could be achieved by an improved integration of term weights in PLSIQ"
0,"The benets of model combination are also very substantial"
1,"In all cases the uniformly combined model performed better than the best single model"

1,"In terms of computational complexity despite of the iterative nature of EM the computing time for TEM model tting at K  128 was roughly comparable to SVD in a standard implementation"
0,"For larger data sets one may also consider speeding up TEM by online learning 11"
1,"Notice that the PLSIQ scheme has the advantage that documents can be represented in a lowdimensional vector space as in LSI while PLSIU requires the calculation of the high dimensional multinomials Pwjd which oers advantages in terms of the space requirements for the indexing information that has to be stored"
0,"Finally we have also performed an experiment to stress the importance of tempered EM over standard EMbased model tting"
